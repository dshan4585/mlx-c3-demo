# MLX C3 Demo

This is a proof-of-concept project using Apple's [mlx-c](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-c) API for the [C3 programming language](https://github.com/c3lang/c3c).

The C3 Language is a new programming language that is very close to pure C, with added modules, safety features, and defer statements.

Currently, I have tested the [C examples](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-c/tree/main/examples), and they worked quite well. However, the [example-safe-tensors.c](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-c/blob/main/examples/example-safe-tensors.c) is not stable due to issues beyond my capability and time constraints.
